# Telemedicine-App
Beginnings of building an app that allows healthcare staff and patients to communicate effectively in real-time.
## Technology
### Language and IDE
Swift on Xcode, HTML
## Ideas
### Names
perMd, MedAir, BiHealth, Telematics, Wirelessly
### Features
1. Insert and access medical history.
2. Offer users different categories of doctors, like dentists and psychiatrists.
3. (ideal) Quick consultation between doctors and patient using video call.
4. Allows physicians or nurses to automatically send prescriptions to their nearest pharmacy.
5. Allow for translators to connect on app.
### Current Problems
During the current pandemic, Black people, Latinos, and Native-Americans have more coronavirus cases but are not getting adequate testing.
How do we make sure that Blacks and Latinos are able to get adequate testing and diagnosis while using the app?
According to the article, deaths and cases are disproportionately affecting African Americans in most states.

**Things to Consider:**
- This is the result of pre-pandemic realities. Many of them do not have the means to afford health insurance, and are at a higher risk for being exposed to the virus.
- Residing in places that are not near any clinics, and might have trouble commuting to receive prescription (home delivery?).
- Blacks people have higher rates of underlying conditions, so higher importance to communicate with people that have those conditions while also contracting the coronavirus (patient keeping in touch and updating on symptoms?).
- Close living quarters, so delivering pandemic essentials for people with no access or lack of funds.
- Collect info on covid testing centers in community hotspots and information on whos providing transportation to those centers.
- Provide messages and info on covid in different languages.
